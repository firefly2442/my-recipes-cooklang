Use a #rolling pin{} to crush the @herb stuffing{} that you put in a #plastic bag{}. Do small amounts at a time. Place crushed stuffing on a plate.

Pound @boneless chicken{} between #waxed paper{} until very thin.

Dredge the chicken in @cooled melted butter{} and then in the crushed herb dressing/stuffing mix.

After it is coated, roll chicken into a small mound. (If the chicken breast is large, cut it in half after pounding.)
